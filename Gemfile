# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
# gem "jekyll", "~> 3.7.0"

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
# gem "minima", "~> 2.0"

# it does not seem necessary to install themes when using github pages, but
# leaving them here for now just in case...
# gem "jekyll-theme-cayman"
# gem "jekyll-theme-architect"
# gem "jekyll-theme-merlot"

# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
