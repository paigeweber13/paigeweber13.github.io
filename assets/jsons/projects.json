    "description": "The focus of Weber's research with Dr. Saule was to develop a tool that would allow students and experienced programmers alike to develop a clearer picture of how their code maps to the hardware. Fine Hardware Visualization is the product of this work. During her time working on this project, Weber has gained valuable knowledge about profiling modern multicore processors. They learned how to leverage intel's model-specific registers to analyze performance, developed her ability to independently manage projects, gained valuable knowledge about prototyping and experimenting, and greatly improved her abilities as a C++ programmer. The source code for this project is released under the GNUv3 license and is <a href='https://github.com/paigeweber13/fine-hardware-visualization'>available here</a>"

    "description": "This project is an implementation of Craig Reynolds's \" Boids\" program written in plain Javascript and WebGL. Weber created this for a computer graphics class, working from the ground up with no API to work with. Even much of the linear algebra was written by her! Weber was able to use much of her skill in high-performance computing by optimizing away unnecessary copies in array addition and implementing a 3D grid system so that boids only look for neighbors among neighboring cells. This project presented several challenges, like trying to squeeze a reasonable amount of performance out of Javascript math. Additionally, tuning parameters ended up being incredibly difficult. In the future, Weber would like to explore WebGL compute shaders to speed up the distance calculation and improve performance. You can play with this program yourself by clicking <a href='https://paigeweber13.github.io/boids-webgl/'>here</a>."

    "description": "In 2019, Weber attended a rare offering at UNCC: a high performance computing course taught by someone who had worked in the field. For her term project, Weber wrote an optimized implementation of LU decomposition, a common algorithm that allows the equation Ax = b to be computed in linear time for a given A. This project required modeling performance, writing an implementation, evaluating performance of that implementation, and then tuning it so that actual performance approached the expected performance. This problem turned out to be very difficult, but Weber did demonstrate speedup in larger matrices. They gained valuable knowledge about how C/C++ compilers generate code, why OpenMP schedules are important for performance, and how to model performance. They also gained experience with conan, a popular build and dependency tool for C++. If you'd like to see her work, <a href='https://github.com/paigeweber13/fast-lu-decomposition'>the repository is available here</a>. Notable files include `src/lu_decomp.cpp` and `experiments/Experiment Analysis.pdf`."

    "description": "One of Weber's courses at UNCC was in programming language theory, and for her term project they used Haskell to visualize the Julia set. The name of the project is a portmanteau of the word 'fractal' and 'haskell'. This project gave Weber the valuable opportunity to learn functional programming principles. As someone unfamiliar with functional programming, this was a challenge for Weber, but they quickly began to see why this style is so popular. They leveraged haskell's lazy evaluation to allow for optional parameters, explored parallelism to speed up image generation, and wrote unit tests to practice good software engineering practices in Haskell.

    "description": "Weber frequently uses open-source software in her work and personal life. They believes in helping others and giving as much as one is able, so they contributes to repositories on github in her spare time. In one case, Weber contributed by rewriting <a href='https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/likwid/pull/303'>two outdated examples in the likwid repository</a> from the ground up. In another, they improved the troubleshooting steps in the <a href='https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide/pull/28'>instructions for building a mechanical keyboard</a>."
